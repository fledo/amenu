amenu
=====

A simple application launcher very much inspired by [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).

Installation
------------

Download the [latest](https://github.com/fledo/amenu/releases/latest) standalone `amenu.exe` or clone the repo and run `amenu.ahk`.
 
Usage
-----

 1. Press `win + space` to open the amenu interface.
 2. Start typing to search for programs.
 3. Press `enter` to launch the selected program matching your query.

Dependencies
------------

The executable should be fairly portable. The script was tested with [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/) v1.1.24.00 and requires at least v1.1.20.00.

Settings
--------

 - Size, position and color of gui.
 - Font name, color and size.
 - Delimiter and spacing between matches.
 - Hotkey to toggle gui.
 - Tray icon visibility.
 - Directories to be scanned for .exe files.
